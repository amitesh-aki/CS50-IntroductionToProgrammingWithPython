'''
In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

def main():
    name = input("What's your name? ").lower()
    hello(name)

def hello(to="world"):
    print("hello, ",to)

main()
